=================================

1. The Binaries 
---------------
We deliver (depending on the archive type) two binaries, namely

- ./sp2b_gen.exe    a precompiled version of the data generator for Windows
- ./sp2b_gen        a precompiled version of the data generator for Linux

In addition, this directory contains three text files familynames.txt,
givennames.txt, and titleword.txt. These files contain random keywords
and are used as a basis for data generation and are required. To run
the data generator with standard options (50000 RDF triples will be
generated), simply type

> ./sp2b_gen (under Linux), or
> sp2b_gen.exe (under Windows)

from a shell. The output format is RDF in simple NTriples syntax.

The data generator is platform-independent (in particular, files generated under
Windows and Linux are identical modulo line break encoding) and does not use any
external library, thus the binaries should work on any standard system. If you run
into any problems with the binaries, you may consider compiling the generator
from sources. More information on compilation can be found in the README
file in the src directory (sp2b/src/README).


2. Command Line Options 
-----------------------
Usage: ./sp2b_gen [BREAK_CONDITION] [OUTFILE], where

BREAK_CONDITION (choose one of the following):
-t n            -> produces n triples [DEFAULT, with n=50000 triples]
-s n            -> produces n KB of data
OUTFILE: name of the output file [DEFAULT='sp2b.n3']

The current version number is plotted right at the beginning, before data
generation starts. 


3. License 
----------
The SP^2B data generator has been published under the Berkeley
License and is open source. Detailed licensing information can
be found in the attached COPYING file.
