Converting RDQL test suite to SPARQL

Check some test have \u and some have raw UTF-8 bytes still
    test-S-01 has \u00E9
    test-S-02 has literal UTF-8 bytes
    test-S-03 has \u00E9
    test-S-04 has \u00e9
    test-S-05 has \u03b1

Replace "SELECT *"
(NB printing fixed)

Fix by adding str()

To Do:

1/ Check for uses of str() latr when URI equals agreed (and implemented)

2/ Check manifest for commented out tests

3/ Reduce duplications.

Known outstanding:

A/ Tests involving string compares of URIs don't work.
   test-A-01.rq
   test-A-02.rq

B/ Uses of model9.n3 commented out 
   Has illegal langtag&datatype literals
