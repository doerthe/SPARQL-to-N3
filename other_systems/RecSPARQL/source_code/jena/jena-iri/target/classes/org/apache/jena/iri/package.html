 <p>An implementation of RFC 3987, Internationalized Resource Identifiers,
 and of related standards.</p>
 <p>Use an IRIFactory to parse Strings as IRI objects
 which:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li> report violations of the standards, 
 <li>permit
 accessing the components of the IRI.
 <li> support IRI normalization
 <li> support the IRI and URI comparison ladders
 </ul>
 
<p>An IRIFactory allows:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>The setting of conformance levels,
   particularly identifying which standard(s) to enforce
   <li>The creation of IRI objects, checking
   them against the selected standard(s)
   <li>The setting of optional behaviours, as 
   specified in the various standard(s)
  </ul>
  <p>The easiest way to use this package is to use
 one of the preconfigured factories, implementing
 RFC 3987 or RFC 3986 or a combination implementation
 appropriate for Semantic Web applications.
 See the documentation for IRIFactory for more information.
 </p> 
<p>This implementation is limited to 16bits,
and hence approximately Unicode 2.1 support.
While the Unicode 4.1 code charts are used,
all characters from these
greater than \uFFFF are ignored.
Behaviour with Unicode 4.1 IRIs in Java 1.5,
using characters greater than \uFFFF
is undefined.
This limitation will not be reviewed until
Java 1.6 is fully released, and Jena migrates
from supporting Java 1.4 and 1.5 to supporting
Java 1.5 and 1.6.
