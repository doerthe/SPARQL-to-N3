  The spec element shows that the violation is defined in a particular
  specification. 
  The included text elements give  text from the specification to be included in 
  documentation and error messages.
  Each text may include a section or a fragment.
  Each text may include a component to narrowly scope the text.
  If there is more than one text then:
     all are included in the documentation
  and either:
     all have a different component and the text applies to that component only.
     or
     none have a component and the first text is used in any error message
 -->

<!--- The also element 
   If the also element has a preceding spec element
   then it increases the scope of that spec to include the referenced specification.
   In this case there may not be a fragment or section.
   
   If there is no preceding spec element, then this element
   shows that the violation does apply to the referenced specification,
   even though no text is offered.
   In this case, the section or ref attributes may be used to give more
   information, or if not, the section or ref attributes of a preceeding
   also element.
