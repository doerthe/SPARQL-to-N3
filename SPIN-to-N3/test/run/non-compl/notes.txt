e.g., to a given run manifest:
python3 run_manifest.py --manifest ../cases/sparql11-test-suite/functions/manifest.ttl --compliance

e.g., to run an individual case:
python3 run_manifest.py --manifest ../cases/sparql11-test-suite/functions/manifest.ttl --test 'CEIL()' --compliance

e.g., to run a generated query, check log output:
eye ../../auxiliary-files/runtime.n3 /Users/wvw/git/n3/sparql2n3/SPARQL-to-N3/SPIN-to-N3/test/cases/sparql11-test-suite/subquery/sq10.rdf --query tmp/n3query.n3 --nope 


-- general
'having' clause not supported in sin3?
     (cannot find it in aux.n3)
no support for named graphs?
bind does not seem to support expressions 
    (e.g., BIND(?o+10 AS ?z); code works if +10 is dropped)
no support for operations in the SELECT clause?
    e.g., SELECT ?s ?num (ROUND(?num) AS ?round)
no support for limit in subquery?


-- aggregates
COUNT 3: having not applied by sin3
AVG with GROUP BY: having clause not applied by sin3
agg empty group: ok (normative lists columns even if no results)
COUNT 4-7, 'Protect from error in AVG', 'Error in AVG', 'GROUP_CONCAT 2': bugs in sin3?
    maybe, some of them because we missed the following: 
    "Aggregates apply expressions over groups of solutions. By default a solution set consists of a single group, containing all solutions."
    https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#aggregates
COUNT 8b: not even sure what that group-by does here XD (by expression??)
SUM: rounding difference in sin3


-- property paths
do not finish (commented out for now)
(pp16) Duplicate paths and cycles through foaf:knows*
(pp25) Diamond, with loop -- :p+
(pp36) Arbitrary path with bound endpoints
(pp37) Nested (*)*

extra universal outputted; do we support named graphs?..
(pp06) Path with two graphs
(pp07) Path with one graph
(pp34) Named Graph 1
(pp35) Named Graph 2

results for x path* y should also include x:
(pp14) Star path over foaf:knows

bug in sin3 (precedence?)
(pp31) Operator precedence 2
(pp33) Operator precedence 4


-- bind
all bugs in sin3 (9/10)
no support for expression in bind?


X bindings - don't think we support this?


X entailment


-- exists
named graphs:
Exists within graph pattern
Nested negative exists in positive exists: ok (normative lists columns even if no results)


-- functions
most of the tests apply operations in SELECT clause; 
doesn't seem like this is supported (e.g., SELECT ?s ?num (ROUND(?num) AS ?round))
n3Query.n3 always ends up referring to wrong variable


-- grouping
Group-3, Group-4, Group-5: grouping on variables from optional


-- negation
mostly bugs in sin3
Positive EXISTS 2: ok (normative lists columns even if no results)


-- project-expression
none of them work :-( do we support expressions in select clause?

some of them seem evil, though (undefined variables, ...)


-- subquery
sq01 - sq07: graph patterns (which we don't support?)
sq10: sin3 actually seems to be right here. (rdflib also seems to give the wrong answer.)
    https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-filter-exists - "No additional binding of variables occurs."
sq11: sin3 doesn't apply LIMIT in subquery
